## Predictive Modeling for Lung Cancer  
**Tools & Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn  

**Project Website:** [Lung Cancer Analysis](https://sana6952.wixsite.com/lungcanceranalysis)

### Overview  
This project involved building predictive models to identify early signs of lung cancer based on patient symptoms and lifestyle patterns. By applying machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis, the goal was to uncover hidden patterns and improve early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

### Key Contributions  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Developed and compared multiple models including **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Trees**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.  
  - Achieved up to **97% accuracy** using the Decision Tree model in predicting lung cancer presence based on clinical and behavioral data.

- **Association Rule Mining & Clustering:**  
  - Performed **association rule mining** to identify co-occurring symptoms and lifestyle risk factors.
  - Applied **clustering techniques** to group patients with similar health profiles, revealing distinct high-risk cohorts.

- **Data Visualization & Feature Analysis:**  
  - Created detailed plots using **Seaborn** to visualize correlations between features such as age, smoking habits, fatigue, and chronic diseases.
  - Used feature importance scores to rank the most influential predictors of lung cancer risk.

### Impact  
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare, particularly for risk stratification and early diagnosis. The analysis is designed to be accessible to both medical professionals and general users through an interactive website that explains the methodology, insights, and real-world applications.
